# CO-FIT / SMA Smartwatch Protocol Documentation

## Project Goal

This documentation set captures the reverse-engineered BLE communication protocols used by the CO-FIT / SMA smartwatch ecosystem (app package: `com.szabh.smable3`). The goal is to provide a complete, self-contained reference that allows an open-source, privacy-respecting alternative application to fully replicate all device functionality without reliance on the original vendor APK.

All documentation was derived by static analysis of the decompiled Android APK located in `decompiled_apk/sources/com/szabh/smable3/`.

## Architecture Overview

+--------------------+        BLE (Nordic UART Service)       +--------------------+

| com.szabh.smable3  |  <=====================================  | CO-FIT / SMA HW    |

## Packet Frame (Quick Reference)

```
Byte:  00    01    02-03   04-05   06    07    08    09+
       MAGIC HDR   LEN     CRC16   CMD   KEY   FLAG  DATA...
       0xAB
```

- **MAGIC**: always `0xAB`
- **LEN**: big-endian `uint16`, value = `payload_length + 3`
- **CRC16**: computed over bytes `[06 .. end]` using vendor lookup table
- Full details: [01-BLE-COMMUNICATION.md](./01-BLE-COMMUNICATION.md)

## Reading Order

For a new implementor, the recommended reading order is:

1. **01-BLE-COMMUNICATION.md** — understand transport before anything else
2. **02-COMMAND-PROTOCOL.md** — understand how commands are encoded
3. **03-HEALTH-DATA.md** — primary use case (health data retrieval)
4. **08-DATA-SYNC.md** — understand the sync lifecycle end-to-end
5. Remaining docs as needed for specific features
